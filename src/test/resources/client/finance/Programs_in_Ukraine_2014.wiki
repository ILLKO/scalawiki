''This section describes what will happen if this project is funded. Who will do what, and when?''

;List of activities:
:Wikimedia Ukraine will support and organize:
# Wiki Loves Earth - our pilot edition in 2013 was really successful and will go international this year. We will organize both national edition (where we expect to repeat the success of the previous edition) and [[:commons:Commons:Wiki Loves Earth 2014|the international one]], with already 11 countries participating;
# Wikiexpeditions - we plan to conduct at least 10 long-distance wikiexpeditions (by car or by train), 14 medium (by bicycle) and 14 short ones (on foot). Concepts of [[:uk:Вікіпедія:Вікіекспедиції|Wikiexpeditions]] and [[:uk:Вікіпедія:Велоекспедиції|expeditions by bicycle]] have already a good track record;
# Photo grants - getting photos of notable cultural and sports events by sponsoring tickets and/or accreditations;
# Wikimedia education program (WEP) and GLAM workshops - we plan to conduct at least 10 workshops;
# GLAM equipment - we plan to buy a book scanner and use it to scan public domain books from our partner libraries, especially in Lviv region. We have a preliminary agreement with several libraries in Lviv that we will be allowed to scan public domain books, but libraries themselves lack adequate scanning equipment;
# Article contest - following the success of [[:uk:Вікіпедія:WikiBioContest-2013|WikiBioContest-2013]], we want to organize a contest of good and featured articles on a particular topic. The concept is to encourage high-quality articles written by users who have a good knowledge of a particular field and evaluated by the jury of experts in a particular field. We plan to organize two or three similar contests this year, the topic of the one held in spring will be most likely either Astronomy or Media;
# Music projects - we are planning to organize two Free Music Concerts, featuring music by prominent composers in Ukrainian translations. Both translations and performance are licensed under Creative Commons licenses, thus providing Wikimedia projects with free recordings;
# Other wiki events - we plan to organize an event to 200th anniversary of [[:en:Taras Shevchenko|Taras Shevchenko]], most likely an edit-a-thon, but we may also hold some GLAM events if we find interested institutions;
# Publishing - we are planning to publish a new edition of the hand book "How to edit Wikipedia" (postponed from 2013), the 2013 yearly report, brochures on other Wikimedia projects (e.g. ones targeting Wikisource or Wikinews), as well as leaflets on our projects and events (e.g. GLAM or music projects);
# Souvenirs - pens, T-Shirts, cups, souvenir badges etc;
# WM UA Library - buying printed encyclopedic books for WM UA Library, that are needed for writing and improving articles, this time some will have a more narrow scope and will focus on [[:en:Taras Shevchenko|Taras Shevchenko]] and related topics.

<!--EXAMPLE: Wikimedia US-NYC has already negotiated with the owner of the
Algmeine Encyclopedie that if the encyclopedia can be digitized, its
owner will release it under a free license. Funding for this project
will pay for the encyclopedia to be digitized and put into Wikisource.
After that, it will be available for individual volunteers to use
however they like, in the Yiddish Wikipedia.-->

| Given the growth of our activities and lack of any permanent facilities for work, meetings and storage (most of documents and materials are currently stored in members' homes, and meetings are held either in members' offices or in public places), we would need an office to exercise our activities more efficiently, especially as we will need part-time employees. We are looking for an entry-level furnished office with shared facilities, but in a convenient location in order to be able to organize meetings there.

| As the contest had a huge success and goes international this year, more efforts will have to be dedicated to international coordination. While we can organize a national contest fully on a volunteer basis, we lack qualified and available volunteers for such activities as coordinating international teams, international media support, research of partners and sponsors on the international level or contacting international jurors. We expect this work to be done by a part-time employee who is expected to work half-time from March to June. Ideally we would hire a student majoring in Communication, Public Relations or a similar sphere.

;Total cost of project:
:37,982.00 USD

;Total amount requested from the [[Grants:Index|WMF Grants Program]]:
:33,195.00 USD

;Additional sources of revenue that may fund part of this project, and amounts funded:
:4787.00 USD

=== Non-financial requirements ===
''See a [[Grants:Index/Non-financial_assistance|description of nonfinancial assistance available]]. Please inform Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) of any requirements for non-financial assistance now.''

;Requests for non-financial assistance:
* We will need informational support for Wiki Loves Earth, in particular, post(s) on WMF blog and an international banner in the SiteNotice;
* We would be glad if Wikimedia Foundation could provide a Wikimania scholarship to the winner of the international part of Wiki Loves Earth, otherwise it will be funded from this grant
* We may need supplies, printed materials and other merchandises (T-shirts, stickers, badges, calenders, posters etc) for outreach from Wikimedia Foundation

<!--- EXAMPLE:
*We'll need five Wikipedia T-shirts to distribute as prizes for our project launch event. We've already contacted WMF to request the shirts. We don't think it will be cost-effective to produce the shirts locally, considering that we only need five.
*We've contacted trademark at wikimedia dot org to request the use of Wikimedia's marks on our banners.
*We may want to publish a blog post on our project on WMF's blog. We will need help reaching out to the communications
team at WMF to coordinate this.--->

== Impact ==
''In the sections below, please describe how the project is related to the Wikimedia mission and Wikimedia's strategic priorities.''

=== Fit to strategy ===
;How will this project support the key organizational objectives of:
;*increasing reach (more people will access or contribute to Wikipedia or our other projects),
;*participation (more people ''actually'' contributing),
;*quality (more content, more useful content, or higher-quality content),
;*credibility (more trust in our projects),
;*organizational maturity and effectiveness (how it will move you or the Wikimedia community forward),
;*or financial sustainability (how it will help you achieve more in the long run)?
;This statement should address at least one of the strategic priorities listed here specifically. See [[Grants:Index/Criteria|WMF Grants Program criteria for decisionmaking]].
::This project will:
:*increase reach and participation (more people will contribute and to Wikipedia thanks to workshops and other events, to Wikimedia Commons during WLE and to the other  Wikiprojects via images uploaded),
:*quality (more free pictures to illustrate the articles with, more high-quality articles thanks to article contests and other events),
:*credibility (more trust in our projects, e.g., Wikipedia and Wikisource),
:*organizational maturity and effectiveness (growing volunteer base, getting more experience, purchasing equipment that will be used by our volunteers),
:*financial sustainability (new partnerships that may be useful for us in general).
<!--EXAMPLE: The project will provide a large amount of previously unavailable high-quality material
that Yiddish-speaking Wikipedians can immediately incorporate into the Yiddish Wikipedia.
It will therefore primarily benefit the quality of Yiddish Wikipedia.-->

=== Benefits ===

;If the project will benefit a specific online community, please tell us.
:Ukrainian Wikipedia, Wikisource, Wikivoyage and Wikinews directly, likely also Crimean Tatar Wikipedia directly; Wikimedia Commons via image uploads (especially WLE) and all the other Wiki projects using these images

<!---EXAMPLE: This project will directly benefit French Wiktionary, as we expect to increase the
number of expert editors on that project through this series of workshops.--->

;Please provide a brief statement about how the project is related to other work in the Wikimedia movement. For example, does the project fit into a work area such as GLAM, education, organizational development, editor retention, or outreach?
:The main focus of this project is Outreach since it will be aimed at recruiting and supporting new Wikimedians and building strong relationships with cultural and educational institutions. Particular programmes fit into GLAM (in particular, partnership with museums and libraries), education (collaboration with universities), organizational development (purchasing equipment that will be used by organization members) and editor retention (presenting souvenirs to the most active users).

<!---EXAMPLE: The project falls into the GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museum) program area
since it will be targeting Wikipedians working with archives.--->

;If successful, will the project have the potential to be replicated successfully by other individuals, groups, or organizations? Please explain how in 1–2 sentences.
:We are always open to exchanging experience with other chapters and thematic organizations. The projects having, in our view, most potential to be successfully replicated, are Wiki Loves Earth (held only in Ukraine in 2013, joined by already a dozen of countries in 2014), Wikiexpeditions and GLAM scanning initiative.

<!---EXAMPLE: This project has a high potential to be replicated by other groups in the region. For one thing, we will
develop some high-quality outreach materials in a local language and will be thoroughly documenting
the successes and failures of this project, in essence producing a project manual for other organizations
and groups doing similar work in local region.--->

;Please list other benefits to the movement here.
:The positive press coverage generated by the launch events (WLE, article contests, edit-a-thons) and new partnerships should increase the presence of free knowledge groups in our country and awareness of the general population with our projects.

<!--- EXAMPLE: The positive press coverage generated by the launch event should increase the
presence of free knowledge groups in our country.--->
